## Introduction 
This is a Power BI project on Sales Performance.
In this project, I undertook a thorough exploration of sales Performance and my primary objectives of the analysis were:
1. Identifying sales performance trends over time, enabling a deeper understanding of the dynamics driving sales fluctuations.
2. Analyzing Geographic Performance: By examining sales performance across diverse locations, the project sought to discern regional variations and identify areas of strength or opportunity.
3. Identifying Key Influencing Factors: Through analysis, the project aimed to pinpoint the critical factors exerting the most significant influence on sales outcomes, providing actionable insights for strategic decision-making.

## Data Preprocessing and Transformation

At the beginning of the analysis, attention was directed towards data preprocessing, involving data cleaning and transformation processes. One challenge was that I only had the order date. To see trends over time, I created new data points like "Day Name",Year‚Äù and "Day of the Week" from the order date.

## Findings of the analysis

Through careful analysis, the project unveiled compelling insights into sales performance. Total sales amounted to $2,297,200.86, with 5009 transactions recorded over the analysis period. Notably, California emerged as the top-performing state by sales, underscoring its pivotal role in driving overall sales performance.

## Recommendation 
- Focus on the West Region: Since the West region is showing the highest sales, it makes sense to allocate more marketing resources there. This could involve targeted advertising 
 campaigns, promotional events, or partnerships with local businesses to further boost sales.

- Marketing Plans for the South Region: Given that sales are lower in the South region compared to other areas, it's important to develop specific marketing plans tailored to this region's needs and preferences. This might involve market research to better understand the demographics and consumer behavior in the South, and then crafting marketing strategies that resonate with this audience.

- It appears that the Technology category has a significant impact on overall sales averages. This insight suggests that technology-related products are driving a considerable portion of the company's sales and it's crucial to incorporate the Technology category into marketing strategies effectively.  if the Technology category has a particularly strong influence on sales in the West region, then focusing marketing efforts on promoting tech products in that area could yield significant returns. This will lead to Overall Sales growth.
